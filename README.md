# Autonomous_Gdrive_Downloader
Autonomous Gdrive Downloader from CSV

So this code, I don't really own this code completely. I modified the existing code that I found in the internet. 
The actual idea behind this code is my bad bosses wanted me to download all of those file that already in company's google drive. I dont know why they give me the order to download all of those

### How to use
1. Put all of the URL of googke drive inside of .csv file
2. And then open the main.py and run it
3. wait for a sec. Actually not a sec, it depends on how fast ur internet and how much the files u put on it
4. Voilla... I kicked the boss ass
