# Autonomous_Gdrive_Downloader
Autonomous Gdrive Downloader from CSV

So this code, I don't really own this code completely. I modified the existing code that I found in the internet. 
The actual idea behind this code is my bad bosses wanted me to download all of those file that already in company's google drive. I dont know why they give me the order to download all of those

### How to use
1. Put all of the URL of google drive inside of <a href="https://github.com/diidhul/Autonomous_Gdrive_Downloader/blob/7a7cd6f54969b3e2fa9a5edb220598d9081222ce/url.csv">.csv file</a>.
2. And then open the <a href="https://github.com/diidhul/Autonomous_Gdrive_Downloader/blob/7a7cd6f54969b3e2fa9a5edb220598d9081222ce/main.py">.main.py</a> and run it
3. wait for a sec. Actually not a sec, it depends on how fast ur internet and how much the files u put on it
4. Voilla... I kicked the boss ass
5. <a href="https://github.com/diidhul/Autonomous_Gdrive_Downloader/blob/ff35d2b858372184d8602115f7b943fb6966cbf9/hasil">Here</a>is the result files.
